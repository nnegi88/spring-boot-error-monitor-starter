# Maven Central Setup Guide (New Process)

This guide covers the new streamlined process for publishing to Maven Central via https://central.sonatype.com

## Overview

The old JIRA-based system at issues.sonatype.org has been replaced with a modern, automated system that's much faster and easier to use.

## Prerequisites

- [x] GPG key for signing (already configured)
- [ ] Sonatype Central account
- [ ] User token for authentication

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Sonatype Central Account

1. Go to https://central.sonatype.com
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. **Important**: Choose "Sign up with GitHub" 
   - This automatically verifies your ownership of `io.github.nnegi88`
   - No manual verification needed!

### 2. Verify Namespace

Once logged in:
1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click "Add Namespace"
3. Enter: `io.github.nnegi88`
4. It should be automatically approved since you signed in with GitHub

### 3. Generate User Token

1. In your account, go to "Account" â†’ "User Token"
2. Click "Generate User Token"
3. Copy the generated token (you won't see it again!)
4. This token is used instead of your password for deployments

### 4. Configure GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository:

```bash
# Your Sonatype username (usually your email)
gh secret set OSSRH_USERNAME

# The user token you just generated (NOT your password)
gh secret set OSSRH_TOKEN
```

### 5. Enable Deployment in Workflows

Once you have your credentials, uncomment the deployment sections in:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` (lines 69-75)
- `.github/workflows/snapshot.yml` (lines 65-72)

### 6. Test Deployment

```bash
# Test with a snapshot first
gh workflow run "Deploy Snapshot"

# Then do a release
gh workflow run "Release to Maven Central"
```

## Benefits of the New System

- **Instant namespace verification** when using GitHub login
- **No waiting** for JIRA tickets
- **Modern UI** with better documentation
- **Faster sync** to Maven Central (usually < 30 minutes)
- **Better security** with user tokens instead of passwords

## Troubleshooting

### "401 Unauthorized" Error
- Make sure you're using the user token, not your password
- Regenerate the token if needed

### "Namespace not verified" Error
- Ensure you signed up with GitHub
- The namespace must match your GitHub username (io.github.nnegi88)

### GPG Signing Issues
- Your GPG key is already configured
- Public key uploaded to keyservers
- Using empty passphrase as configured

## Next Steps

After setup:
1. Your artifacts will be available at: https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.nnegi88/spring-boot-error-monitor-starter
2. They'll sync to Maven Central within 30 minutes
3. Maven Central URL: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/nnegi88/spring-boot-error-monitor-starter/
