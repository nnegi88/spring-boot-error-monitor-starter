# Release Notes

### üéâ What's New
This patch release focuses on bug fixes and improving the reliability of error notifications. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version for better stability.

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Log Level Filtering**: Corrected inverted comparison logic that was causing INFO and DEBUG logs to trigger notifications even when minimum level was set to ERROR
- **Fixed Webhook URL Delivery**: Resolved issue where webhook URLs weren't being passed to notification services, causing "Target host is not specified" errors
- **Fixed Slack Message Format**: Corrected Slack Block Kit JSON structure to prevent "invalid_blocks" errors
- **Property Placeholder Resolution**: Spring property placeholders (like `${spring.application.name}`) now properly resolve to actual values instead of showing literal placeholder strings

### üìù Documentation
- Updated README.md with complete and accurate configuration properties
- Added documentation for rate limiting configuration options
- Improved troubleshooting section with property placeholder resolution details

### üîß Technical Details
- Modified `NotificationOrchestrator.shouldSendNotification()` to use correct ordinal comparison
- Enhanced `SolidNotificationAutoConfiguration` and `LogbackAppenderConfiguration` with Spring Environment integration
- Updated `SlackMessage` class to include required `emoji` property in Text objects
