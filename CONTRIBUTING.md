## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow these coding standards:

1. **Java Code Style**:
   - Use Java 17+ features where appropriate
   - Follow standard Java naming conventions
   - Use meaningful variable and method names
   - Keep methods small and focused
   - Add Javadoc for public APIs

2. **Spring Boot Conventions**:
   - Use `@ConfigurationProperties` for configuration
   - Implement proper auto-configuration with conditions
   - Follow Spring Boot's conditional bean registration patterns
   - Use appropriate Spring annotations

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all new functionality
   - Use meaningful test method names
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Achieve good test coverage

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch** for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding guidelines

3. **Write or update tests** for your changes

4. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

5. **Run integration tests**:
   ```bash
   mvn verify
   ```

6. **Check code formatting** (if available):
   ```bash
   mvn spring-javaformat:apply
   ```

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add support for custom error templates

- Add template engine for customizing error notifications
- Support for both Slack and Teams custom templates
- Include template validation and fallback mechanisms

Fixes #123
```

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for test improvements
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `perf:` for performance improvements

### Testing

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=ErrorMonitorHealthIndicatorTest

# Run specific test method
mvn test -Dtest=ErrorTrendAnalyzerTest#testSpikeDetection

# Run with coverage
mvn test jacoco:report
```

#### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify component integration
3. **Configuration Tests**: Tests for Spring Boot auto-configuration

#### Test Guidelines

- Use `@MockBean` for Spring context tests
- Use `@Mock` for pure unit tests
- Create test fixtures in `src/test/resources`
- Use meaningful assertions with descriptive messages
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Performance Testing

Run performance benchmarks:

```bash
cd spring-boot-error-monitor-benchmark
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="io.github.nnegi88.errormonitor.benchmark.BenchmarkRunner"
```

### Demo Application

Test your changes with the demo application:

```bash
cd spring-boot-error-monitor-demo
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to interact with the demo interface.
